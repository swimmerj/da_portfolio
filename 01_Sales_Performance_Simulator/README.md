# Project 1: Sales Performance & Commission Simulator

## Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world scenario for a Commercial Analyst role. The goal is to analyze sales performance using transactional data, calculate commission bonuses for the sales team, and identify key market trends.

## Business Problem
The management team needs a transparent way to:
1. Track monthly revenue performance adjusted for returns.
2. Calculate a proposed **5% commission bonus** for sales personnel based on a 30% margin.
3. Identify top-performing countries and customers.

## Tech Stack
- **SQL (MySQL):** Data cleaning, ETL, and logic implementation (filtering returns, calculating revenue).
- **Power BI:** (In Progress) Dashboarding and visualization.

## Project Structure
- `SQL_Scripts/`: Contains the ETL and cleaning logic.
    - `01_data_cleaning.sql`: Removes returns, handles missing customer IDs, and standardizes date formats.

## Key Insights (To be updated)
- *Coming soon after Power BI analysis.*

## Data Source
- **Dataset:** Online Retail II (UCI Machine Learning Repository).
- *Note: The raw data file is not included in this repo due to size limits.*
