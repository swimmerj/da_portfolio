# Data Analytics Portfolio

### About Me
Hi, I'm **Juraj Plavka**.
I am an **Operations Specialist transitioning into Data Analytics**.
My background in operations gave me a strong foundation in process optimization and real-world problem solving. Now, I apply that business mindset to data analysis using **SQL**, **R**, **Tableau**, and **Power BI** to drive decision-making and efficiency.

This repository serves as a portfolio of my projects, documenting my journey from raw data to actionable business insights.

### Portfolio Projects

#### [1. Sales Performance & Commission Simulator](01_Retail_Sales_Performance/)
**Goal:** Analyze 2 years of retail transaction data to evaluate sales trends and simulate the financial impact of a new commission scheme (5% of Margin).

* **Business Problem:** The company needed to move from static Excel reporting to dynamic monitoring and required a financial simulation for a proposed bonus structure.
* **Key Tech:**
    * **SQL:** Strict ETL pipeline, data cleaning (handling nulls, cancellations), and type casting.
    * **Power BI:** DAX measures for financial logic (`Estimated Margin`, `Commission Bonus`) and interactive dashboards.
* **Outcome:** Identified Top 3 export markets (EIRE, Netherlands, Germany) and validated that the new commission scheme costs ~1.5% of total revenue.

#### [2. Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis](02_Cyclistic_Case_Study/)
**Goal:** Analyze 12 months of bike-share data (5 million+ rides) to identify behavioral differences between casual riders and annual members to drive membership growth.

* **Business Problem:** The marketing director aims to convert casual riders into annual members. The analysis required processing large-scale data to find distinct usage patterns for targeted marketing.
* **Key Tech:**
    * **R (Tidyverse):** Handling large datasets (5M+ rows) that exceeded Excel limits; performed advanced cleaning, string standardization, and feature engineering.
    * **Tableau:** Designed an interactive dashboard with heatmaps to visualize the contrast between "Commuter" (Member) and "Leisure" (Casual) schedules.
* **Outcome:** Discovered that casual riders peak on weekends with 2x longer trip durations, while members are strict weekday commuters. Recommended a "Weekend Warrior" membership tier to bridge the gap.

#### [3. Telco Churn & Retention Strategy](03_Telco_Churn_Analysis/)
**Goal:** Diagnose the root causes of customer churn in the premium Fiber Optic segment and quantify revenue loss to design a retention strategy.

* **Business Problem:** The Product Director needed to understand why Fiber Optic customers were leaving at double the rate of DSL users and specifically which high-value segments were at risk.
* **Key Tech:**
    * **SQL (MySQL):** Feature engineering (`Tenure_Group`, `Churn_Count`), View creation, and logic validation to isolate high-value customers.
    * **Power BI:** Built a "Strategy Dashboard" featuring Drill-through capabilities for sales teams.
	* **Outcome:** Uncovered a "Death Spiral" segment (Fiber + Electronic Check) with **58% churn**. Proposed a "Golden Path" strategy (Auto-Pay + Tech Support) to reduce churn to **17%**.
