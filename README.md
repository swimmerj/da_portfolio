# Data Analytics Portfolio

### About Me
Hi, I'm **Juraj Plavka**.  
I am an **Operations Specialist transitioning into Data Analytics**.  
My background in operations gave me a strong foundation in process optimization and real-world problem solving. Now, I apply that business mindset to data analysis using **SQL**, **R**, and **Power BI** to drive decision-making and efficiency.

 This repository serves as a portfolio of my projects, documenting my journey from raw data to actionable business insights.

### Portfolio Projects

#### [1. Sales Performance & Commission Simulator](01_Sales_Performance_Simulator/)
**Goal:** Analyze 2 years of retail transaction data to evaluate sales trends and simulate the financial impact of a new commission scheme (5% of Margin).

* **Business Problem:** The company needed to move from static Excel reporting to dynamic monitoring and required a financial simulation for a proposed bonus structure.
* **Key Tech:**
    * **SQL:** Strict ETL pipeline, data cleaning (handling nulls, cancellations), and type casting.
    * **Power BI:** DAX measures for financial logic (`Estimated Margin`, `Commission Bonus`) and interactive dashboards.
* **Outcome:** Identified Top 3 export markets (EIRE, Netherlands, Germany) and validated that the new commission scheme costs ~1.5% of total revenue.
